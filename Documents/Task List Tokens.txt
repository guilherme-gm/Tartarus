While developing Tartarus, parts of the code may need to be marked to be revisited later.

These are the Comment Tokens used in Tartarus:

- TODO (Normal Priority)
Means that something should be coded there

- CHECK (Normal Priority)
Means that this part needs official confirmation.

- IMPROVE (Low Priority)
Means that it might be possible to improve this part in the future
